{% pullquote %}
You {" can't use multiple pullquotes in a single pull quote tag "}. So that's
kinda sad. But really man {" you couldn't do it before either "} Now it just
fails a little more gracefully. So yeah, c'est la vie.  {" Don't know why
you'd try for multiple pullquotes anyways... " }
{% endpullquote %}

{% pullquote %}

And that is the end of {" another fine test by your friendly two-character
change path "}  Whee!

{% endpullquote %}
